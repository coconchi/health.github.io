          <!-- <div class="img-fluid"><img src="img/health_ppl.png" alt="Image not found!"></div> -->
          <p>Health systems are highly complex, and are formed by the interactions of many agents, including patients, providers, insurance companies or organizations, and more.
            Many countries around the world are facing tough challenges in diverse systems: rising costs, insufficient insurance coverage, and poor public health are just some
            of the difficulties that policymakers are attempting to address. The Simulation Unit hs created an agent-based model of a national health system with the objective of
            informing health policy through ex-ante analysis of policy changes.
            <p> The model includes patients, providers, insurance companies, and exogenous health shocks, and is
            informative about several outcomes, including health status of the population, health care
            costs, insurance coverage, and quality of care. Because the model is a bottom-up, agent-based model instead of a standard general equilibrium model, it recognizes the
            complexity inherent in these systems, and is able to incorporate knowledge of diverse fields such as behavioral economics and epidemiology.</p>

        <h2>Flexible and context-specific</h2>
        <p>The model is programmed for maximum flexibility, and its inputs can be adapted
        to a wide variety of countries and health contexts. This is acheived through adapting the
        insurance landscape to imitate the national mix of public and private insurance as well as
      regulation. The model also equipped to receive epidemiological data and information about health
    expenditures and economic variables, such as income inequality. </p>
